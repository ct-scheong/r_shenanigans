This algorithm applies a two-dimensional Gaussian Kernel Regression to an image denoising problem. 
The rendering of the greyscale image can be changed by tweaking the radius (i.e. a 9x9 block as shown below) and the threshold h = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10. 
Results show that the best image corresponds to a h = 1, and as h increases, the picture will get more blurry.
