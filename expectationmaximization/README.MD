This is an Expectation-Maximization Algorithm applied to an image segmentation problem. We will be extracting a set of features, applying the histogram clustering algorithm, and output the clusters as different image segments. This algorithm is applied to a radar image taken by synthetic aperture radar.

The algorithm is tested on different values of K clusters and different threshold parameters (tau). A cross section of the results are shown below:
